# Coding-Practices
Where I dump my code for practicing:  
Code in this folder are assignments that I have comoleted in some Coursera courses. I am listing all the Coursera courses I have done in my personal page:https://haolinwang2001.github.io/  
  
#### Introduction_to_Tensorflow: 
- basic single layer neural network
- **callback functions**
- normalisation
- Training using Fasion MNIST
- **Convolution**
- **MaxPooling**
- **Keras ImageDataGenerator**   

  
 #### Convolutional Neural Network
- **augmentation**
- **dropout**
- **transfer learning**, freeze layers
- move file around to feed ImageDataGenerator
- plot training and validation accuracies
- multiclass classifier for the Sign Language MNIST dataset
- parse raw CSV file with pixel info
